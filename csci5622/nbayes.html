            <!-- Assignment
            (a) Overview: Here, describe NB and what it can be used for. While you are only required to use the standard multinomial NB (that we discuss in class), also define and describe Bernoulli NB as well. 

            (b) Data Prep. All models and methods require specific data formats. Supervised modeling requires first that you have labeled data. Next, it requires that you split your data into a Training Set (to train/build) the model, and a Testing Set to test the accuracy of your model. ONLY labeled data can be used for supervised methods. Explain this and show an image of the sample of data you plan to use. LINK to the sample of data as well. Also include information and a small image of the Training Set and Testing set and explain how you created them and why they are (and must be) disjoint.

            (c) Code. You may choose to use either R or Python. Create code that performs NB on your dataset. LINK to the code. Note that R can perform NB on mixed data. However, if using Python/Sklearn/MN Naive Bayes, your data will need to be only numeric. 

            (d) Results. Discuss, illustrate, describe, and visualize the results. Include the confusion matrix and the accuracy. 

            (e) Conclusions. What did you learn (and/or what can you predict here) that pertains to your topic? -->
