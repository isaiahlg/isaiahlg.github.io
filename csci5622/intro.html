            # Introduction
            
            Some of the lowest income countries in the world are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (World Bank Data, n.d.). A lack of infrastructure and access to essential services like health care, education, and electricity are often cited as key contributors to this persistent wealth gap (United Nations, n.d.). To help combat this, the United Nations (UN) created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to be accomplished by 2030.

            However, reliable data on economic livelihoods remain scarce in the developing world, hampering efforts to study these outcomes and to design policies that improve them (Jean et al. 2016). In particular, it is critical to understand the baseline socioeconomic status of the countries in question in order to quantify the impact infrastructure projects could have on poverty reduction. This information is critical for decision-makers to decide where to allocate scarce public resources.

            
            
            ## Q&A
            Does electrification create sustained economic change for connected communities?
            Does access to electricity affect the assets that people own?
            Does access to electricity have any affects on health outcomes?
            Are farmers more or less likely to have access to electricity?
            Is access to electricity even distributed among ethnic groups?
            Do people without electricity access still own electric appliances?
            How does access to electricity affect genders equally?
            Does access to electricity affect the lives of children in the households?
            Are landowners more likely to have access to electricity?
            What demographics are most predictive of access to electricity?
            Are there socioeconomic clusters in rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa?
