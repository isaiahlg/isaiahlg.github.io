            <p>
                Some of the lowest income countries in the world are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (World Bank Data, n.d.).
                A lack of infrastructure and access to essential services like health care, education, and electricity are 
                often cited as key contributors to this persistent wealth gap (United Nations, n.d.). To help combat this, 
                the United Nations (UN) created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to be accomplished by 2030. 
                SDG 7 is to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” (United Nations, n.d.). 
                However, dozens of countries in SSA still have connected less than half of the population (Figure 1).

                Mini-grids are a type of electricity network that contains the components to produce, store, transmit, 
                distribute, and consume electricity on a relatively small scale. Because of the remote location of many 
                unelectrified communities, along with a bounty of equatorial sun, mini-grids have taken off in the last 
                decade as an alternative to electrification. They offer the same consumer experience of clean, reliable 
                A/C power 24/7, but often at a fraction of the cost of extending the national grid, averaging around 50% 
                cheaper in rural areas (Maqelepo et al. 2022). A 2021 report from McKinsey estimates that to achieve 
                universal access to electricity in Africa, about 40 percent of households would be best served by mini-
                grids and off-grid solutions.

                Despite the lower relative cost of a mini-grid compared with grid extension, achieving universal access 
                will still cost hundreds of billions of dollars. This could come from both public and private sources, 
                but will also need to compete with the myriad of other ways in which capital can be used towards poverty 
                reduction. After all, universal access to electricity is just one of seventeen sustainable development 
                goals. Nathan William’s frames the problem succinctly in his 2015 literature review on barriers to private 
                investment into distributed energy projects in Africa:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                    “Lack of capital from public and donor sources has severely impeded achieving access goals, leading to 
                    calls for greater private sector participation in electrification activities. However, due to the high 
                    level of risk associated with decentralized electrification projects in low-income areas, marginal 
                    expected returns on investment, and a lack of clear and effective public policy, the private sector has 
                    not shown significant interest in participating in such projects…Future research should evaluate the 
                    relative costs and benefits of these interventions in order to provide robust policy guidance to decision 
                    makers in developing countries” (Williams et al. 2015). 
                </i>

            <p>
                Many questions around the impacts of electrification remain, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does electrification create sustained economic change for connected communities?</li>
                <li>Does access to electricity affect the assets that people own?</li>
                <li>Does access to electricity have any affects on health outcomes?</li>
                <li>Are farmers more or less likely to have access to electricity?</li>
                <li>Is access to electricity even distributed among ethnic groups?</li>
                <li>Do people without electricity access still own electric appliances?</li>
                <li>How does access to electricity affect genders equally?</li>
                <li>Does access to electricity affect the lives of children in the households?</li>
                <li>Are landowners more likely to have access to electricity?</li>
                <li>What demographics are most predictive of access to electricity?</li>
                <li>Are there socioeconomic clusters in rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This research endeavors to find answers to such questions.
