            # Introduction

            Some of the lowest income countries in the world are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (World Bank Data, n.d.). A lack of infrastructure and access to essential services like health care, education, and electricity are often cited as key contributors to this persistent wealth gap (United Nations, n.d.). To help combat this, the United Nations (UN) created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to be accomplished by 2030. Among them include ending poverty, hunger, and universal access to electricity. The figure below shows a graphic of all 17 goals.

            Key to the achievement of these goals is accurate, up-to-date reporting of progress. However, reliable data on economic livelihoods remain scarce in the developing world, hampering efforts to study these outcomes and to design policies that improve them (Jean et al. 2016). In particular, it is critical to understand the baseline socioeconomic status of the countries in question in order to quantify the impact infrastructure projects could have on poverty reduction. This information is critical for decision-makers to decide where to allocate scarce public resources. Many of these countries lack coordinated efforts to gather nationally representative data.

            International development organizations like the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also carry out initiatives aimed at poverty alleviation. To compensate for the lack of data in developing regions, they have developed a program called the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). This program carries out extensive survyes iwith hundreds of questions across tens of thousands of households every few years in developing countries. The questions cover topics from household demographics, assets, and health outcomes. They constitute one of the most comprehensive data sources on poverty alleviation and public health in the world. 

            Sierra Leone is a small country in Western Africa that has one of the highest poverty rates in the world (World Bank, 2020). An 11-year civil war and a 2-year Ebola outbreak hurt the national economy. However, recent years have seen an increase in stability, such as the peaceful transition of power between political parties after the 2018 presidential election (Al Jazeera, 2018). There is a sense of optimism that Sierra Leone has escaped the conflict trap and that its economy will continue to grow quickly (Doss, 2023).

            The most recent DHS survey conducted in Sierra Leone was in summer of 2019, and the results have been compiled and made available on the DHS website on request. The survey covers over 13,000 households across over 500 clusters across the country from every region. With this data, we can make deep inquiries about the nature of wealth and poverty in Sierra Leone. 

            ## Research Questions

            This research ventures to ask the following questions:
            
            1. Are there socioeconomic clusters in rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa?
            1. How many different groups are there among Sierra Leonean households in terms of demographics?
            1. What are the demographics of the poorest and wealthiest quantiles of households?
            1. How does poverty vary spatially across Sierra Leone?
            1. What are the most important variables for predicting a household's wealth?
            1. Does access to electricity have any effects on wealth?
            1. Are farmers more or less likely to have access to electricity?
            1. Is the size of ones farm important for determining wealth?
            1. Can you determine a household's economic outlook by looking at their house?
            1. Do people without electricity access still own electric appliances?
    
            
            ## Q&A

            Below are the quick answers to the questions above. For more thorough answers, visit the [Conclusion](/csci5622/conclusion.html) page.

            1. How common is access to electricity and ownership of household electronics? Quite rare. Fewer than 1 in 6 households have access to electricity, and even fewer own fridges or TVs. However, battery powered appliances like cell phones and radios though are quite common. 
            1. How many different groups are there among Sierra Leonean households in terms of demographics? The natural grouping based on demographics are into 3 clusters, but the wealth index is split into 5 quantiles. 
            1. What are the demographics of the poorest and wealthiest quantiles of households? Wealthier households tend to have more men and fewer children, and poorer households are often without a man but many dependents.
            1. How does poverty vary spatially across Sierra Leone? Yes, it does. The wealthiest region is the greater Freetown area, and the poorest is the Northern Provice. 
            1. What are the most important variables for predicting a household's wealth? Type of floor material, type of roof material, ownership of a television, access to a quality toilet, and having income other than farming.
            1. Does access to electricity have any effects on wealth? Yes it does! It correlates positively with wealth. 
            1. Are farmers more or less wealthy than non-farmers? Less wealthy! Owning farmland correlates negatively with wealth class. 
            1. Is the size of ones farm important for determining wealth? No, it is not. Among those who have farms (about half of respondents), there is no meaningful difference between their mean wealth index. 
            1. Can you determine a household's economic outlook by looking at their house? Yes! Floor, roof, and wall material are each very predictive of wealth index. Earthen floors and natural building materials indicate low income.
            1. Do people without electricity access still own electric appliances? Yes they do! Especially battery powered appliances such as watches and cell phones, but sometimes televisions as well.
