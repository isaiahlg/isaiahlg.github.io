            <h4>Demographic & Health Surveys</h4>
            <p class="text">
                A key source of survey data from sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries comes from
                the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program from the United States Agency for International 
                Development (USAID). 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Raw data from DHS must first be requested through the information request form, with the intended
                use of the data registered. Once access is granted, the data can be fetched in two ways: (1) by 
                downloading a zip file folder from the website, and (2) by requesting data over the API. The documentation
                for the API is limited but can be found on the DHS website 
                <a href="https://api.dhsprogram.com/#/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. A sample of a downloaded
                zip file can be found <a href="https://github.com/isaiahlg/csci5622mod1/tree/main/data/SLHR7ADT" target="_blank">
                here</a>. To use the API, an R package was developed by a group of researchers for the rOpenSci project
                and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rdhs" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The implemntation
                of this code for pulling data from the API, processing it, and cleaning the data can be found on
                <a href="https://github.com/isaiahlg/csci5622mod1/blob/main/module1.rmd" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

                To compliment the DHS data, data from the Twitter API was also extracted.
