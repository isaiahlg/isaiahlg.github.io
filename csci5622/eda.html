            <h4>Data Fetching</h4>
            <p class="text">
                A key source of survey data from sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries comes from
                the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program from the United States Agency for International 
                Development (USAID). 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Raw data from DHS must first be requested through the information request form, with the intended
                use of the data registered. Once access is granted, the data can be fetched in two ways: (1) by 
                downloading a zip file folder from the website, and (2) by requesting data over the API. The documentation
                for the API is limited but can be found on the DHS website 
                <a href="https://api.dhsprogram.com/#/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. A sample of a downloaded
                zip file can be found <a href="https://github.com/isaiahlg/csci5622mod1/tree/main/data/SLHR7ADT" target="_blank">
                here</a>. To use the API, an R package was developed by a group of researchers for the rOpenSci project
                and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rdhs" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The implemntation
                of this code for pulling data from the API, processing it, and cleaning the data can be found on
                <a href="https://github.com/isaiahlg/csci5622mod1/blob/main/module1.rmd" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

            <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
            <p class="text">
                Once the data had been imported into R from the DHS, data inspection and cleaning began. The immediate
                concern was around the size of the data. For a single survey round in a single country (Sierra Leone, 2019), 
                there were 13,399 observations of 3,455 variables, equating to 46,293,545 data points. This is an 
                enormous dataset that needed to be pared down. To determine what data to keep, one must reference the
                <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG4/Recode7_DHS_10Sep2018_DHSG4.pdf" target="_blank">DHS's Standard 
                Recode Manual</a>, a 204-page PDF that describes what each of the thousands of questions are indicating.
                This research is primarily concerend with economic indicators at the household level, and so only the first 
                two sections of the questionnaire were kept, or around the first 200 variables. This reduced the file size by 15X,
                making it editable in a visual relational database such as Google Sheets. Each variable was then manually 
                inspected and decoded to determine if it was of interest. Another 3/4 of the columns were dropped, leaving just
                56 variables behind.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Each column was coded as charater or integer values, and so the columns were manually reisnpected again. The 
                variables that were not truly numeric were converted to factors for proper treatment. Finally, the data were
                ready for summary and visualization. Below are some screenshots of the data.

                of columns and rows!</p>

            <p class="caption">Figure 6: After cleaning the data, we have many fewer columns of data, and the categorical data is 
                recategorized as factor data instead of numeric data.

            <h4>Data Visualization</h4>
            <p class="text">
                The first set of visualizations were a set of histograms looking at the range of values for each of the survey variables. 
                Remember that each record in the surveys is a single household.
            </p>

                of Sierra Leone lies. ie less than 500 meters above sea level.

                the country.

            <p class="caption">Figure 9: These are the various native tongues of each household. One might expect more than 6 categories, given 
                that there are 16 ethnic groups in Sierra Leone, such as the Temne and the Mende. I'll need to see what each of these labels
                correspond to.

                right tail with some households having upwards of 20 members.

            <img class="figure" src="/csci5622/charts/hist/womenHist.png">
            <p class="caption">Figure 11: This shows the number of women aged 15-49 years old in the household. Interestingly, almost 3000 households
                have none, but a majority have 1. Some go up to 6 or 7! 
            </p>
            <img class="figure" src="/csci5622/charts/hist/menHist.png">
            <p class="caption">Figure 12: This shows the number of men aged 15-49 years old in the household. It's a sobering chart, showing us that
                a majority of households have no men present. One can see from these two charts that women often anchor the household.
            </p>
            <img class="figure" src="/csci5622/charts/hist/childrenHist.png">
            <p class="caption">Figure 13: This shows the number of children under 5 years old in the household. Most households do have small children,
                but only a couple. One might wonder why the survey does not capture household members aged 5-15 years. 
            </p>
            <img class="figure" src="/csci5622/charts/bar/watersourceBar.png">
            <p class="caption">Figure 14: This historgram shows us the various sources of drinking water. It's quite varied. However, to get more 
                out of this, one must map the values to the corresponding water sources. 
            </p>
            <img class="figure" src="/csci5622/charts/bar/assetsBar.png">
            <p class="caption">Figure 15: This figure is perhaps the most interesting one -- it shows the number of households that own a particular asset,
                with a reference bar included at the top for the total number of households surveyed. One can see that radios are the most commonly 
                owned asset, with televisions in second. Access to electricity is extremely low, with fewer than 1 in 5 households having access. Very few
                households seem to be able to afford motorcycles, much less a car.
            </p>
            <p class="text">This concludes the Exploratory Data Analysis section. In future work, we'll begin to find patterns within the data with methods
                such as association rule mining and unsupervised clustering.
