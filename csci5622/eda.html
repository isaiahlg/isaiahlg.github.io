            <h3>Demographic & Health Surveys</h3>
            <h4>Data Fetching</h4>
            <p class="text">
                A key source of survey data from sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries comes from
                the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program from the United States Agency for International 
                Development (USAID). 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Raw data from DHS must first be requested through the information request form, with the intended
                use of the data registered. Once access is granted, the data can be fetched in two ways: (1) by 
                downloading a zip file folder from the website, and (2) by requesting data over the API. The documentation
                for the API is limited but can be found on the DHS website 
                <a href="https://api.dhsprogram.com/#/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. A sample of a downloaded
                zip file can be found <a href="https://github.com/isaiahlg/csci5622mod1/tree/main/data/SLHR7ADT" target="_blank">
                here</a>. To use the API, an R package was developed by a group of researchers for the rOpenSci project
                and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rdhs" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The implemntation
                of this code for pulling data from the API, processing it, and cleaning the data can be found on
                <a href="https://github.com/isaiahlg/csci5622mod1/blob/main/module1.rmd" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

            <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
            <p class="text">
                Once the data had been imported into R from the DHS, data inspection and cleaning began. The immediate
                concern was around the size of the data. For a single survey round in a single country (Sierra Leone, 2019), 
                there were 13,399 observations of 3,455 variables, equating to 46,293,545 data points. This is an 
                enormous dataset that needed to be pared down. To determine what data to keep, one must reference the
                <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG4/Recode7_DHS_10Sep2018_DHSG4.pdf" target="_blank">DHS's Standard 
                Recode Manual</a>, a 204-page PDF that describes what each of the thousands of questions are indicating.
                This research is primarily concerend with economic indicators at the household level, and so only the first 
                two sections of the questionnaire were kept, or around the first 200 variables. This reduced the file size by 15X,
                making it editable in a visual relational database such as Google Sheets. Each variable was then manually 
                inspected and decoded to determine if it was of interest. Another 3/4 of the columns were dropped, leaving just
                56 variables behind.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Each column was coded as charater or integer values, and so the columns were manually reisnpected again. The 
                variables that were not truly numeric were converted to factors for proper treatment. Finally, the data were
                ready for summary and visualization.
            </p>
            <h4>Data Visualization</h4>
            <p class="text">
                The first set of visualizations were a set of histograms looking at the range of values for each of the variables.
