            <p class="text">
                Some of the lowest income countries in the world are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (World Bank Data, n.d.).
                A lack of infrastructure and access to essential services like health care, education, and electricity are 
                often cited as key contributors to this persistent wealth gap (United Nations, n.d.). To help combat this, 
                the United Nations (UN) created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to be accomplished by 2030. 
                SDG 7 is to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” (United Nations, n.d.). 
                However, dozens of countries in SSA still have connected less than half of the population (Figure 1).
