                (a) Overview: Here, describe clustering, including partitional vs, hierarchical. Note the distance metrics used. Discuss how you plan to use clustering to engage in discovery. Have two images. More is fine.
                (b) Data Prep. All models and methods require specific data formats. Clustering requires ONLY unlabeled numeric data. Explain this and show an image of the sample of data you plan to use. LINK to the sample of data as well. 
                (c) Code. Use Python to code k-means clustering and use R (hclust) to code hierarchical clustering. Use Cosine Similarity as the distance measure for the hclust. LINK to the code.
                (d) Results. Discuss, illustrate, describe, and visualize the results. Have at least one dendrogram and at least one clustering image (that is not a dendrogram). What values of k did you use for k - means (you should use at least 3 different k values to compare). What did the Silhouette method tell you about the "best k". Include a vis of the silhouette results. Using the hierarchical clustering, how did this compare and coincide with the k-means? What value of k does hclust suggest?
                (e) Conclusions. What did you learn that pertains to your topic?
