    "Instead of using the low-resolution embeddings aggregated to every 0.25 degrees, we have the original embeddings at every 0.01 degrees for each of the points in the SustainBench dataset in Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isaiahlg/mosaiks-embeddings-for-sustainbench-wealth-mapping/). Thanks to [Luke Sherman](https://www.globalpolicy.science/luke-sherman) from Stanford for pulling them for us even though the MOSAIKS API was down. How does the spatial resolution of the DHS clusters and the dense MOSAIKS embeddings compare? Repeat the analysis using the dense embeddings. How does the accuracy compare with the coarse resolution embeddings?\n",

    "## Bonus Assignment 2: Geospatial Errors\n",
    "Associate the errors in the model above with the original geospatial datapoints in the SustainBench dataset and plot them on a map. Do you see any patterns? Are there any areas of the map that perform worse than others? If so, what do you think you could do to reduce the geographic bias of the model?\n"
